# Production readiness report

## Implemented

A compiled React/TypeScript/Tailwind dashboard, strict validated admin APIs, additive SQLite schema initialization, hashed copy-once tenant keys, exact domain checks, production CORS allowlists, header-key CSRF rationale, safe errors, redacted diagnostics, source-isolated RAG, real analytics, provider health and configuration-only OpenAI-compatible provider switching are implemented. Docker now builds the frontend in the build stage. Automated checks and audits pass; see `TEST_REPORT.md`.

## Deployment gates and honest limitations

- Provider changes are non-secret staged metadata. Apply generated environment configuration through a secret manager and restart. There is intentionally no database secret storage.
- Test Connection may make a bounded probe to the endpoint an administrator supplies; it does not mutate the running provider and does not return/log the key.
- SQLite/local object/vector/outbox implementations are single-node defaults. Use managed shared services before horizontal scaling.
- Health CPU/memory is process/host telemetry, not cluster monitoring. Add external observability and SLO alerts.
- Top pages remains an empty state because the public API currently captures no page URL. No value is fabricated.
- Browser smoke tests cover responsive authentication/navigation/logout; exhaustive UI workflow coverage remains a future test expansion, although API families are integration-tested.
- The frontend main bundle triggers Vite's size warning; code-split routes for slower clients.
- Complete authorized staging tests against actual provider entitlements/quotas remain deployment-specific. No live provider was accessed for this release.

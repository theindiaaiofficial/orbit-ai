Machine-readable Playwright output: `browser-e2e-result.json`. Responsive captures: `playwright-desktop.png` and `playwright-mobile.png`.

The API suite covers authentication, tenant isolation, client/key/domain lifecycle, prompt versions, analytics, settings/provider staging, health, widget configuration, RAG, uploads, leads and security validation. Browser coverage validates login, protected rendering, navigation/empty state, desktop/mobile menu behavior, screenshots, logout and protection after reload. It does not automate every UI mutation path; those flows have API integration coverage.

Vite reports a non-failing 680 kB main-chunk warning. Route-level splitting is a future performance improvement.
